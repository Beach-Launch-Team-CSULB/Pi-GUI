I have the codes and GUI to work on Windows and still working to get it working on Raspberry Pi (Debian Linux Based OS)

You will need to install Python to be able to run Tkinter GUI Library in the Python environment
Link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to have VS Code (or any IDE that is able to run Python and has a terminal)
Link: https://code.visualstudio.com
	- Need to install the Python extension in VS Code

You will also need the MySQL server downloaded and have the database be on (make sure you do localhost)
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

Open folder Pi-GUI-main in VS Code

Ctrl+Shift+P to open the prompt search

Type in Python: Select Interpreter

On the pop-up, select the recommended (or something that says AvionicsGUI_env)

What you have selected is a virtual environment that has all the libraries already pre-installed for the GUI, saves all the hassle
for you to download different libraries on the command line or VS Code terminal

Assuming that everything is set up, which includes having the code running in the virtual environment and the database running,
here is what you need to check:
	- On RenegadeGUI.py lines 21 - 26 are the MySQL connector, this allows you to be able to connect to the database on the localhost (your computer)
	  Change the username and password according to how you installed you MySQL server
	- On RenegadeGUI.py lines 32 - 34 are the SQL commands, if this is your first time running the code, uncomment lines 32 and 33
	  Any subsequent runs will require you to comment them off

Run the code and the GUI will pop up, if it's not in full windows screen, expand the screen

On the Code VS terminal, you should see that the random data is being recorded, when you exit the GUI, the recorded data will then be saved,
show have much data has been recorded during the run, all the data being shown in the database, and how rows from the table in the database
